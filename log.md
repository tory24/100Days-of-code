I've become used to keeping track of my progress, and while I'm not going to begin a new 100 day challenge until the new year, I still would like to keep track of any updates I feel like I want to log.

### December 8, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Updated this repo, and watched a coouple AWS Keynotes and began the next FCC Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Watched a couple AWS Keynotes, from their reinvent event?... Curious to see what it's all about, watched the intro keynote, and one on Machine Learning. Learnt a little, but going to give their 'hands-on labs' a go. 
I also started the drum pad challenge on FCC. Going to try do it in HTML, CSS, JS. But want to give React a go later, after I have it running properly.

**Time**: 2 hours~

### December 5, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Restarted the AWS Amplify app.

**Thoughts**: I can't seem to get the backend connected to the front even when I follow the instruction. Not entirely sure what's gone wrong.

**Time**: 1 hour


### December 4, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished looking through the AWS services info, and started going through their online resources, to create a Fullstack React app through AWS Amplify.

**Thoughts**: It's pretty interesting to see how to quickly and fairly easily it is to build an app through AWS Amplify. It's just following instructions, but I feel like this is information that can just be useful, but not necessarily vital to any role I may have in the near future. But I personally think it's importnat to understand as much as possible, so that I have a clearer understanding of the bigger picture.

**Time**: 3 hours~

### December 3, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Did some research into AWS services.

**Thoughts**: Learning about 'The Five Pillars' for a well Architected Framework as according to AWS.

**Time**: 2 hours.

### December 2, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started reading an article about AWS Fundamentals.

**Thoughts**: Interesting to learn a bit about AWS's services, because I think it's near essential part of being a developer.

**Time**: 1 hour
