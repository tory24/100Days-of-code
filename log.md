### December 4, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished looking through the AWS services info, and started going through their online resources, to create a Fullstack React app through AWS Amplify.

**Thoughts**: It's pretty interesting to see how to quickly and fairly easily it is to build an app through AWS Amplify. It's just following instructions, but I feel like this is information that can just be useful, but not necessarily vital to any role I may have in the near future. But I personally think it's importnat to understand as much as possible, so that I have a clearer understanding of the bigger picture.

**Time**: 3 hours~

### December 3, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Did some research into AWS services.

**Time**: 2 hours.

### December 2, 2020

**Thoughts**: Interesting to learn a bit about AWS's services, because I think it's near essential part of being a developer.

**Time**: 1 hour
