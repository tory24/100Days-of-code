### Post 100 Days Challenge Log
I've become used to keeping track of my progress, and while I'm not going to begin a new 100 day challenge until the new year, I still would like to keep track of any updates I feel like I want to log.

### December 28, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished Day 6

**Thoughts**: Thought I'd quickly try finish Day 6 Part 2 of Advent of Code. Was a bit trickier than I expected, but I've been a bit lazy recently with Christmas.

**Link(s) to Work**: TBC

**Time**: 1 hour


### December 23, 2020
**Today's Progress**: More Advent of Code.

**Thoughts**: Really enjoying this, fun to do some more algorithm based challenges.

**Link(s) to Work**: TBC

**Time**: 1 hour


### December 22, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked more on Advent of Code Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Got through Day 4 and 5, just starting Day 6.

**Time**: 3 Hours


### December 21, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Advent of code challenge again.

**Thoughts**: It's a lot of fun, main aim is to just get the answer, so I'm not worried so much on how clean the code is, but it is a little painful XD.

**Time**: 3 Hours~


### December 20, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Tried the Advent of code challenge.

**Thoughts**: It is pretty interesting, could be a good challenge over Christmas so I don't stop practicing completely.

**Time**: 1 hour~


### December 18, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Went through a tutorial for Tensorflow.js

**Thoughts**: Was interested in giving MI a go, and was told Tensorflow is pretty easy. Went through a bit of the tutorial for JS, so far kind of clueless about what's going on, but haven't been able to give it much time. But I'm excited about hopefully understanding this technology eventually.

**Time**: 1 hour


### December 17, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked through an AWS S3 Introduction lab. I also completed the Drum Machine React version.

**Thoughts**: It's cool to begin to learn how AWS handles data storage, and their interface to use it is fairly straightforward. The React version now works, and passes the tests. But can do with some major improvement, I would like to learn how to add a volume control to it, and make it look a bit more exciting overall.

**Time**: 3 hours


### December 15, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on my resume again.

**Thoughts**: Realised it a bit bland and overloaded with information. Need to spice it up

**Time**: 2 hours


### December 14, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Drum Machine some more, got a React version almost working. The click button doesn't work just yet.

**Thoughts**: Unsure of why it's not working properly, will need to utilise more react features

**Time**: 2 hours


### December 11, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked more on the Drum Machine.

**Thoughts**: Immediately found out about a HTML DOM property called 'textContent'. Straight up fixes my issues from the other day, with grabbing the innerHTML. So I learnt something new today which is good!
Found a way to overlap audio files using 'cloneNode()'.
Completed the challenge using vanilla JS, HTML & CSS. Will next try to complete the project using React, Bootstrap and maybe jQuery. Also aim to make it look good as well.
- I completed it by passing the tests they provide.
- Then I altered it to how I would do it, it functions exactly the same as before but won't pass the tests they provide.

### December 9, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Drum Machine FCC Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Got it working to play sounds on 'keydown' and 'click' using event listeners. The keydown was very easy to do, but I had trouble with getting the 'click' event listener to play the sound, because it doesn't register an event when the element gets clicked as opposed to the keydown.

I also found out that using the innerHTML of an element grabs everything within the element including any child elements.

E.g: '<button><audio id="A"></audio>A</button>' 

So when I was trying to use the letter within the button to grab the audio tag with associated id, it would grab everything within the button. But I got around this by moving the letter in front of the audio tags, and only grabbing 'element.innerHTML[0]'.

**Time**: 2-3 hours


### December 8, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Updated this repo, and watched a coouple AWS Keynotes and began the next FCC Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Watched a couple AWS Keynotes, from their reinvent event?... Curious to see what it's all about, watched the intro keynote, and one on Machine Learning. Learnt a little, but going to give their 'hands-on labs' a go. 
I also started the drum pad challenge on FCC. Going to try do it in HTML, CSS, JS. But want to give React a go later, after I have it running properly.

**Time**: 2 hours~

### December 5, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Restarted the AWS Amplify app.

**Thoughts**: I can't seem to get the backend connected to the front even when I follow the instruction. Not entirely sure what's gone wrong.

**Time**: 1 hour


### December 4, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished looking through the AWS services info, and started going through their online resources, to create a Fullstack React app through AWS Amplify.

**Thoughts**: It's pretty interesting to see how to quickly and fairly easily it is to build an app through AWS Amplify. It's just following instructions, but I feel like this is information that can just be useful, but not necessarily vital to any role I may have in the near future. But I personally think it's importnat to understand as much as possible, so that I have a clearer understanding of the bigger picture.

**Time**: 3 hours~

### December 3, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Did some research into AWS services.

**Thoughts**: Learning about 'The Five Pillars' for a well Architected Framework as according to AWS.

**Time**: 2 hours.

### December 2, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started reading an article about AWS Fundamentals.

**Thoughts**: Interesting to learn a bit about AWS's services, because I think it's near essential part of being a developer.

**Time**: 1 hour
