# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge
I've decided to take on this challenge after hearing about it through a podcast. I found that while trying to work through FreeCodeCamp's courses, I would let a few days go by at a time without doing any work. So I am using this challenge to train positive studying habits and to help make my self more accountable in my studies. The challenge will also help me in my effort to start some small projects which I can use to apply what I've learnt, and hopefully help to retain the information, through doing rather than just reading.

## Rules
I don't use twitter, so I won't be tweeting, but I will stick to the one basic rules of the challenge.
1.  **Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.**

I recommend that you commit to no more than 2-3 challenges at a time, ideally 2.
