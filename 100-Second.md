# Second 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Outline for my Second 100 Days of Code Challenge:
I really enjoyed doing the first 100 days, and it really helped keep me in a rhythm of study and to tackle some projects on a consistent basis.
This time around, I'll aim to do the 100 days over the working week [Monday - Friday], and weekends will be optional.
I am using this challenge to train positive studying habits and to help make my self more accountable in my studies. The challenge will also help me to create more projects that demonstrate what I've learnt, and add to my portfolio.

**My Plan**:
* I will spend a minimum of 1 hour a day studying, whether it's through FCC's courses, Udemy or another resource.
* I will again apply my knowledge by working on small projects, that apply my knowledge.
* I aim to have at least 10 small projects completed by the end of the challenge.
* Am considering doing a bootcamp style course at General Assembly

### Day 2 January 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the second last FCC Frontend Challenge; JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit rusty, but keen to figure this out over the next few days. Was going to do vanilla JS, but interestingly I realised it would be far easier to use React. I have yet to feel like React was an easier way of coding, as opposed to vanilla JS, but yeh I'm starting to see how on larger projects with many interacting elements how React is an easier language to work in than Vanilla JS. Also, considering this course is a Front End Libraries Course, it feels appropriate to use a front end library.

### Day 1: January 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began a new 100 Day challenge today, began by finishing off a Tensorflow.js tutorial I had started last year.

**Thoughts**: Pretty interesting to get a small insight into Machine Learning, I plan on diving into the topic a bit more in the future. Today was just a short day, but I aim to finish off the Front end Development FCC Course to start this 100 Days, then figure out where to go next after that.
