# Second 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Outline for my Second 100 Days of Code Challenge:
I really enjoyed doing the first 100 days, and it really helped keep me in a rhythm of study and to tackle some projects on a consistent basis.
This time around, I'll aim to do the 100 days over the working week [Monday - Friday], and weekends will be optional.
I am using this challenge to train positive studying habits and to help make my self more accountable in my studies. The challenge will also help me to create more projects that demonstrate what I've learnt, and add to my portfolio.

**My Plan**:
* I will spend a minimum of 1 hour a day studying, whether it's through FCC's courses, Udemy or another resource.
* I will again apply my knowledge by working on small projects, that apply my knowledge.
* I aim to have at least 10 small projects completed by the end of the challenge.
* Am considering doing a bootcamp style course at General Assembly

**What I've Done So Far**:
* [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/WNGWVbj)

**Time**:

### Day 78 May 28, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on the ladder.

**Thoughts**: I've come to find that the ladder is much harder to figure out than expected, and trying to display the correct data in order is a bit confusing. I think I'll have to sort through the data and create a new object of the information I want, in nested objects, so each stat is under a team_id. Whereas at the moment each stat is its own object, with a team_id.

**Time**: 2-3 hours


### Day 77 May 27, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the ladder component.

**Thoughts**: Tried working out how to display the relevant data in each row. Had an issue trying to do this.state.foo.forEach(), turns out that doesn't work for JSON files, so I just used .map(). Got the <th> row to work, but struggling with displaying the stats for each column and making usre the stat lines up with the correct team. Hopefully it clicks tomorrow, might brute force it then try a simpler method.

**Time**: 6 hours


### Day 76 May 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on fixing the draw component.

**Thoughts**: Spent the day fixing the draw component, it is now more responsive to the page and displays time, date, score as well as displaying the scores in bold for the winning team. Might see if it can do live scores this weekend.

**Time**: 7 hours~


### Day 75 May 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the NRL Project, fixed the Draw component and got it to display the data for each round.

**Thoughts**: Spent all day working on learning how to use API calls within React, and being able to display them properly in a component. I also figured out how to correctly reduce repeated code in React, and seperated components into individual files, which helped me declutter. This project has been suuuper useful with understand how to utilise the versatility of React, as well as learn about how the lifecycle methods work a little better. I accidentally didn't create a safeguard for the componentDidUpdate method, so it just continuously updated and could potentially crash a browser.

**Time**: 7-8 hours


### Day 74 May 24, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Spent today working on a small nrl react project.

**Thoughts**: Decided to help a mate with his NRL project, he asked me to help build a frontend for his NRL App. Today was difficult got a bit stuck for a bit, but eventually figured out how I was going to do it, and am hoping that tomorrow I will get to learn about how to use an API in React properly to generate useful data to the page. I think this is a cool way to actually learn and build something that I have an interest in.

**Time**: 7 hours


### Day 73 May 21, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Decided to test my Reactjs skills and build an NRL site clone, and learn how to use API calls in React.

**Thoughts**: Been a bit slack with committing, it's been a busy few days. But I have still been studying, just haven't committed much. Began working on a frontend design for a friend's project. I aim to build a React based frontend which draws data from his app, and displays it in a user friendly way. The aim is to challenge myself and learn a bit about React APIs and just generally understand React some more.

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 72 May 20, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a backend challenge.

**Thoughts**: Trying to learn a bit more about the backend, and see if I can create a small project that uses a RESTful API.

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 71 May 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Prepared for my second interview today.

**Thoughts**: Spent the morning preparing for my interview, just touched up on some things that I thought I might be questioned on, and worked through some final leetcode problems, to prepare for potentially some more coding tests during the interview.
P.S. I think it went well.

**Time**: 4 hours
s

### Day 70 May 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Spent the day preparing for an interview tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: Looked into a whole range of things, from leetcode challenges, to going over notes I made from my previous interview, to reading a few blogs about working as a developer, and getting through the interview process.

**Time**: 5-6 hours


### Day 69 May 17, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Leetcode Challenges, and looking into Hashmaps.

**Thoughts**: Spent the day working through a few leetcode challenges, they were pretty challenging, but I was trying to utilise objects and hashmap to find the fastest and most efficient code for the problem.

**Time**: 5 hours


### Day 68 May 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Spent some time updating and organising my study notes.

**Thoughts**: Wanted to clean up and organise my notes, getting a bit cluttered and was a bit confusing going through and finding things. Also tried to fill in a few gaps, and looked into hashmaps, objects and Sets.

**Time**: 1-2 hours


### Day 67 May 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through some leetcode questions.

**Thoughts**: Decided to try understand how hashmaps work in algorithm problems. A bit trickier than I expected, however I am starting to understand how it works, at least in small, fairly simple problems.

**Time**: 5 hours


### Day 66 May 12, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continued study of HashMaps and Data Structures in JS.

**Thoughts**: Continued looking into HashMaps, and it lead to looking into other Data Structures, like queues, linked lists and stacks. I went in depth into the differences between Maps and Objects, and when its better to use one or the other. I just want to look a bit further to clarify a few terms, and plan on doing some exercises tomorrow through LeetCode, and implement HashMaps to find a result.

**Time**: 5 hours


### Day 65 May 11, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Studying HashMaps.

**Thoughts**: Spent all day studying HashMaps. It's brought about an important aspect to programming that I am aware of but have so far avoided as it was more important to learn the fundamentals before getting into the technical side of things. It's lead me into studying the technical performance of code, and keeping in mind the speed and memory usage. This is also what my interviewer was looking for in my code. So I looked into Big O notation, and HashMaps vs Loops.

**Time**: 4-5 hours


### Day 64 May 9, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Spent some time looking into HashMaps in JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: I had a job interview last friday, it went well, however I was unable to complete the technical question they had me do in the way they wanted, which was using a HashMap. So I spent some free time tonight looking into HashMaps and taking down some notes, preparing for a potential second interview. Regardless of whether I get a second chance, I think this will be an important topic to cover, as it seems like it's important for frontend development.

**Time**: 1.5 hours


### Day 63 May 6, 2021
**Today's Progress**: APIs & Microservices Cert.

**Thoughts**: Completed the first challege of the APIs cert, I wasn't able to do it without using the hints, however I wasn't satisfied with the answer they gave, because it;
    a/ didn't pass the tests,
    and b/ didn't account for all possible inputs such as the any dates with a year of 5 digits, since the unix time in 64-bit systems can go to the year 23000+.
However even though that wasn't the point of the question, I learnt a bit about timestamps & also the GET request.
Also, managed to get an interview, so excited for that!

**Link(s) to Work**: [Timestamp Challenge](https://github.com/tory24/timestamp-fcc)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 62 May 5, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Started the APIs & Microservices final certificate projects.

**Thoughts**: Started the first project, Timestamp Microservice. Didn't get much time to work on it, but I want to have it done by tomorrow.

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 61 May 4, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished the MongoDB & Mongoose Course in the APIs and Microservices Cert.

**Thoughts**: Is nice to get back into the studying rhythm, however the way the backend is being taught leaves a bit to be desired. So hoping to learn more through independent study/projects. The next course involves making full stack projects, so hopefully that will help a lot with my understanding of how the back end works.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Mongo/Mongoose Lesson](https://github.com/tory24/fcc-mongoose)

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 60 May 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Restarted the APIs and Microservices Mongoose Section.

**Thoughts**: It's been a busy few weeks and I decided it would be best to just restart the Mongoose section, and start new. It fixed a few issues I had with access the Mongo Database. I plan on working through this over today and tomorrow.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Mongo/Mongoose Lesson](https://github.com/tory24/fcc-mongoose)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 59 April 30, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Google Page, and applied for a couple jobs.

**Thoughts**: Continuously applying for roles, really keen to at least get to the interview stage, but it's pretty rough so far. Going to do more work on the FCC course next week, I got a bit side tracked with the Google home page clone.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Google Home Page Replica](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/PoWvzxX)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 58 April 29, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Built a Google Search Page clone.

**Thoughts**: Decided to replicate the google home page, but in the form of my own portfolio. Not sure if it's useful or interesting/overdone, but it was a bit of fun, and interesting to see how it's done. I'm thinking of maybe adding it to my current portfolio as an extra little fun element. I'm designing things through codepen first, as it updates live, then when I'm happy with it adding to the github repo. A part from refreshing a local file on a webpage, I'm not really sure how else it would be done in a way that is useful/practical, maybe it's something I should research.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Google Home Page Replica](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/PoWvzxX)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 57 April 28, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Added some things to my portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Felt that the front page for my portfolio needed a little suggestion to scroll down, so I added a double chevron to the bottom of the full page view, with an animation transition effect that occurs every 6 seconds.

**Link(s) to Work**: * [My Live Portfolio Site](torymos.com)

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 56 April 20, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Did some more work on learning JS backend.

**Thoughts**: Applied for a couple more roles and got a bit more of the FCC course in.

**Link(s) to Work**: [MongoDB Mongoose](https://github.com/tory24/fcc-mongomongoose)

**Time**: 1 hours


### Day 55 April 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for some roles, and had a look at how to speed up my portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: Ran my site through google's page speed insights, and found that gif's are quite large files to use, particularly for mobile users. So I found out how to convert my gifs to mp4's using ffmpeg. Managed to reduce their file size quite a lot, and also realised I was still pulling the gifs from their respective Github location. So I made a folder within the project for these gifs.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 5 hours


### Day 54 April 16, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began the FCC MongoDB Mongoose Curriculum.

**Thoughts**: This was exciting, I feel like I'm starting to really work in a real live environment, obviously not like legitimate, but I'm using real npm packages and databases. And on top of that I've put into practice some of the things I just learnt such as manually adding npm packages to the package.json file, which I did correctly after checking with the npm install mongodb/mongoose command. Keen for the next lesson.

**Link(s) to Work**: [MongoDB Mongoose](https://github.com/tory24/fcc-mongomongoose)

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 53 April 15, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Had a bit more of a look into Express and Node.

**Thoughts**: Wanted to learn a bit more about Express and Node, I didn't feel like it was explained very well in FCC.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 52 April 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished through the 'Basic Node & Express' seciton

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the Basic Node and Express section, really interesting to see more of how the backend works, it's something I really want to learn and understand fully eventually. And I think it's also just useful to know, even if I never have to use it.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Boilerplate Express](https://github.com/tory24/boilerplate-express)

**Time**: 4-5 hours


### Day 51 April 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working on the FCC API and Microservices Certificate again.

**Thoughts**: Want to get through this section on 'Basic Node and Express', so I worked through a bunch of lessons. I'm a little confused about what I'm learning so I will spend time tomorrow researching further online.
But I'm also starting to think of what project I can do that is more inline with my own passions.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Boilerplate Express](https://github.com/tory24/boilerplate-express)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 50 April 12, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through the FCC API and Microservices Certificate.

**Thoughts**: Decided to work through some more challenges in FCC to get me back into the swing of things. And also spent a fair amount of time trying to refine my applicaiton for Atlassian's Internship program.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Boilerplate Express](https://github.com/tory24/boilerplate-express)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 49 April 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working through the FCC Microservices & API certificate.

**Thoughts**: On holidays for two weeks, but figured I'd squeeze in a bit of study today. Currently learning about the Node console.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Boilerplate Express](https://github.com/tory24/boilerplate-express)

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 48 March 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Made a few little touch ups to the site.

**Thoughts**: Spent a lot of the day just making a few little changes to the page, but I realised I need to pay attention to how it works on a phone. So it works well in portrait mode, but as soon as you turn landscape the alignments are all over the place. So I might spend some time next week researching fixing up the mobile experience, which I dont have any experience in, so 

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 47 March 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out what to say in my about me section of my portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Finally figured out what to say in my about me section, and I think it actually sounds and reads well, and isn't too long, which is the hardest part. Also made a bunch of tiny fixes to the page, and tried to do a CSS overlay transition with the email icon, but I think I'll just use some JS to do the transition instead, because it was way too finicky.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 46 March 24, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Doing more work on the portfolio, and getting some advice from friends.

**Thoughts**: Bit scary actually going out and getting advice from people on something I've done, but I'd need outside perspective, before I actually used it in job applications.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 45 March 23, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the portfolio some more, and applied for some Internships.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying trying to fine tune the page, and see what I can do to make it a bit more interesting to catch a recruiter's eye.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 3 hours~


### Day 44 March 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Spent today trying to make a spotify widget that pops open on hover.

**Thoughts**: I was running through some ideas of what to add to my online portfolio, and thought of using a spotify widget. Originally disappointed by the options given by Spotify, I thought of doing a pop-up style widget using just CSS. I'm not overly happy with it, it's a bit janky, but does essentially what I wanted it to do.
I thought it might be a cool little thing to add to the webpage, basically link to my favourite playlist. I think it might be a bit tacky though. But was still interesting to figure out how to make it work. I'm sure there's an easier way to do this with just JavaScript, so I might give that a go tomorrow.

**Time**: 6 hours


### Day 43 March 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on making an SVG to add to the portfolio.

**Thoughts**: I know it's probably not super important, but I got a bit carried away making an SVG image for my site.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 


### Day 42 March 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Decided to work on my portfolio some more.

**Thoughts**: Aiming to beef up the portfolio some more, trying to take some inspiration from modern web design's, so I'm looking at other online portfolio's & websites.
Ended up changing the visual design a whole lot today, moved from quite a colourful page, to a more modern simple design, so it's very clean and easy to follow, without bombarding you with lots of colours. I think I'm happy enough with it to show people, just want to create an SVG to add to it, that basically shows my hobbies & interests without me having to explain them. Overall a very productive day.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 6-7 hours


### Day 41 March 17, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Added a smooth scroll to my web page for anchor tags & began FCC's APIs & Microservices Cert.

**Thoughts**: Today was a really positive day I think, I'm finally learning new things after quickly running through the Responsive Web Design Certificate. I've decided to start going through FCC's APIs & Microservices Certificate, and so far I'm learning a lot of new things, and it's an area I went over briefly while I was using Codecademy, but I had to stop as I realised at the time I just was not ready to learning more about backend, when I barely knew anything about Frontend. So very positive, and I'm excited about what I'll learn tomorrow!
Will get back to my portfolio tomorrow, got a little side-tracked today.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Github Repo for understanding how package.json works](https://github.com/tory24/boilerplate-npm/blob/gomix/package.json)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 40 March 16, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Tested, how to put my short term portfolio from FCC online.

**Thoughts**: Transferred my current wordpress test site to a build of my codepen portfolio page. Kind of diving into the deep end trying to figure this all out. But I think there's enough documentation from both GoDaddy and AWS to guide me through linking my custom domain to the Amplfiy App domain. If this does work, then the page itself is nothing crash hot, very simple and to the point, but I hope to turn it into a React app, and maybe add some little flairs to it to help stand out. -> Got the site working, so now it updates as I push changes to the github repo.
I plan on focusing on this project for the next week and see how far I get.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Digital Portfolio](https://torymos.com)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 39 March 15, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Started working through the Responsive Web Design Certification's CSS Grid Section.

**Thoughts**: Decided to work through the final section, since the RWD Certification hasn't popped up as complete yet. But also I'd forgotten about CSS Grid, so this is probably a good thing anyway.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 38 March 12, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Portfolio Page

**Thoughts**: Finally got the Portfolio challenge finished, took me a bit to figure out how the projects were going to collapse and grow and stretch. Then spent some time figuring out how to add a transition effect to hover elements like socials & the projects. I think I'll use this and build from this as a professional portfolio page, as it's something recruiters seem to want from applicants. Ideally I'll make it far better than this, maybe create a new build but in React first.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/PobaxLj)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 37 March 11, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Portfolio Page

**Thoughts**: Realised I had a bit of a writers block or something with this project, but yesterday I finally kicked into gear and pretty much finished the page. Just need to figure out where to store the images I'll use for my projects.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/PobaxLj)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 36 March 10, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the FCC 

**Thoughts**: Was pretty sick today, so only got about an hour in, and spent most of it fixing a couple issues with the Portfolio Page.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/PobaxLj)

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 35 March 9, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for a few roles, and worked some more on the final FCC Challenge.

**Thoughts**: I have the page complying with the test, but just spending some time to make it look semi-professional.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/PobaxLj)

**Time**:


### Day 34 March 8 2021
**Today's Progress**: Spent time helping a friend with an algorithm, and worked some more on the FCC Portfolio Page challenge.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/PobaxLj)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 33 March 4, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a personal project with a friend who's a dev, and started the final project of FCC's Responsive Web Design Certificate.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting faster at setting up a page, but the course only uses HTML & CSS. But it's cool to notice how I've improved/changed my approach to starting projects.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/PobaxLj)

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 32 March 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's Certificate's 4th Project

**Thoughts**: Decided to work on the next challenge, which is to make a Technical Documentation Page. Was for the most page very easy. Had the most trouble with setting the anchor's for when the page is under 900px, when the media query kicks in, as I wanted the navbar to stay in a fix position. So I tried a bunch of techniques suggested in stackoverflow, and finding a new feature I hadn't heard of before 'scroll-padding-top:' which I set to the height of the navbar. And pretty much fixed the issue I was stuck on for over an hour. 

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Technical Documentation Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/xxRzbPR)

**Time**: 6 hours~


### Day 31 March 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for an Atlassian Internship, and worked a bit on the FCC Chalenge.

**Thoughts**: Probably spent a bit too long fretting over my cover letter, but it's stressful applying for a role that seems perfect for me. I just hope they consider me. Also the product landing page is coming together, I think I'll try finish it off tomorrow, it already meets the challenge criteria, but I want to make it look good, the colours are a bit gross at the moment.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Landing Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/abBVRKv)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 30 March 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the 3rd FCC Responsive Web Design challenge, and spent time looking for jobs.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying trying to build a webpage, its challenging and fun to watch it slowly come to life. Also been looking at and applying for some junior roles, no bites yet, but hoping I get that one company that is willing to take a chance and hire me.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Landing Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/abBVRKv)

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 29 February 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for some jobs, and began working on my digital portfolio again.

**Thoughts**: Testing how to build this site is pretty enjoyable, just stressful thinking about how best to build it, since it demonstrates my work, and shows who I am as a developer.

**Time**: 


### Day 28 February 24, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through the 3rd challenge in the FCC Responsive Web Design Cert.

**Thoughts**: This one's a little harder, just trying to understand how to align items properly along a navbar is a bit confusing.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Landing Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/abBVRKv)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 27 February 23, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through FCC Responsive Web Design Certificate.

**Thoughts**: Working through the flexbox section, I realised how poorly codecademy teaches flexbox, my notes were very brief and confusing. So FCC explained things a bit more clearly, but did not cover as many features of flexbox.

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 26 February 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through FCC Responsive Web Design Certificate.

**Thoughts**: Getting back into it, last week was a bit all over the place. Working through the Responsive Web Design Certificate on FCC. It's been very easy, but nice to learn a bit more about the accessibility features of HTML, and animation in CSS, something I'm keen to explore a bit more.

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 25 February 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Responsive Web Design challenges.

**Thoughts**: Only made it through a few challenges, and applied for a job, which took longer than expected.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 24 February 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Challenges & my portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Needed to get back into a rhythm, the FCC Challenges really help to quickly get back into a learning routine. Also decided to skip ahead and finish the first FCC challenge, to see if I knew enough. Was easy enough, was tasked with building a basic tribute page which I centred around Kobe Bryant, I based it on the example tribute page they provide, but changed it up a litte. But I learnt about a few HTML tags I hadn't encountered before, <cite>, <blockquote> & <figcaption>. The last of which I learnt about but had never used.

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 23 February 15, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished the Mandalorian Helmet, then began work on my digital resume again.

**Thoughts**: Found it hard to stop working on the little CSS project I'm doing. But it's not super useful when compared to trying to make a digital portfolio. So worked a bit on improving that. I guess some of the CSS may come in handy later down the track. I thought of an idea for a portfolio that may double as both a way to promote myself & demonstrate various skills, like knowledge of CRUD, and how to utilise a RESTful API.

### Day 22 February 12, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Ended up beginning a new Mandalorian helmet, but with a bit more detail.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying this CSS challenge, its a fun way of looking at how to design something with quite restrictive constraints. Might start looking at webkits soon and see how they work.

### Day 21 February 11, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working on the Mandalorian Helmet project.

**Thoughts**: Got a bit carried away today and finished my Boba Fett Helmet by writing it purely in CSS. Was actually a lot of fun and kind of relaxing, but stressful at the same time.

### Day 20 February 10, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through a tutorial to make a page similar to the Apple Airpods page. Worked on using CSS and HTML project.

**Thoughts**: Followed a tutorial to recreate how Apple displayed the airpods on their webpage. Learnt how to map a user's scroll to loading a new image on page, and also learnt about preloading, and how it can dramatically speed up the user experience. However it also dramatically increases download sizes, especially when loading 147 high quality images. As a result of this, I learnt about the CDN and how it helps across most of the internet to reduce load times etc. I only have a basic understanding but I realise how important it is for many companies.

Decided to try use pure CSS and HTML to make Boba Fett's helment in a minimalist art style. I think it's mostly doable, and it should hopefully teach me some new little tricks and aspects of CSS that I don't yet know. Managed to get the base green helmet done, need to get the red visor and a few extra bits in.

### Day 19 February 9, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Set up Wordpress through AWS Lightsail, did some FCC Challenges, and worked on learning some more advanced CSS.

**Thoughts**: Finally took the time to learn how to set up a Wordpress site, decided to go through Lightsail, is simple and easy. But I havent fully learnt how to customise a site properly through Wordpress, I'm finding the tool to be a bit clunky, but keen to give it another go tomorrow, to see what I can make. Did a few FCC Challenges and fixed up my timer a bit, added some colour.

### Day 18 February 8, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began learning how to use Wordpress, did some FCC Challenges.

**Thoughts**: Decided that I need to learn how to use wordpress and host a site through AWS, considering Wordpress is used for most sites, and AWS powers most of the internet, learning how to do this would hopefully be beneficial for job prospects.

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 17 February 6, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Making up for missed days, spent some time working on the resume.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying this, is a good way to learn new things and do something that might help me secure a job.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 16 February 5, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Did an hour of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FCC. Then began work on my digital resume.

**Thoughts**: Just going back through HTML, CSS basics to cover anything I might've missed or forgotten about, was properly taught about CSS variables. Also began designing my digital resume, I have an idea of what I want to do, so hopefully I can teach myself how to build a webpage like as I have planned.

**Time**: 4-5 hours


### Day 15 February 4, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up a few FCC Challenges, and began a digital resume.

**Thoughts**: I've applied for a few job but realised I dont have enough skills so I appear as not well rounded. So I'm planning on learning a bit of back end so I can host some projects online and add them to my digital resume which will help me show not tell. Also it will be a good way to broaden my knowledge and abilities.

### Day 14 February 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp. And enquired about General Assembly's short bootcamps.

**Thoughts**: Haven't recieved the certification for the frontend libraries course which is a little annoying. But began the Responsive Web Design course, just to see if there's anything more that might help me with the HTML, CSS basics.
Finding it difficult to appear as a suitable candidate for jobs, so thinking of doing a bootcamp to help get my foot in the door somewhere. 

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 13 February 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finsihed with the FCC Timer

**Thoughts**: I finally got the timer working as expected, it now counts down from the session length, then at zero it will reset to the break length, after this it will reset to the session length and repeat the process until the reset button is pressed or the start/stop button is pressed again. Really happy that I finally got it working, a major change is that I realised it's much easier to use multiple funcitons within the component so that it can access state, rather than placing some generic functions outside the component, which I did for a couple challenges from before.

### Day 12 February 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working on getting the timer to work as expected.

**Thoughts**: Running into to some trouble, trying to figure out how to update state and immediately call on the updated state in a single call. But the setState callback doesn't seem to work as expected for me. So close to finishing this.

### Day 11 January 29, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Timer.

**Thoughts**: Struggling to have the timer update when the session length is increased. If I try updating through a function, it updates a few clicks later, so when session is 27, timer is only at 26:00. I think I need to have it update within state, but not quite sure how to get that working.

**Time**: 1.5 hours


### Day 10 January 27, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Timer.

**Thoughts**: Yeh this is tough, I've found code that has helped me to get the timer working. But I'm trying to understand how to stop it, update content on screen as other items update, like updating the timer and the session length is changed. Then after I have that figured out, I'll need to get it to change to the break time. However I've learnt today how to simplify some of my older code by using a variable to change the state in a function.
    i.e this.setState({ [e.target.name] : e.target.value })
So hopefully this helps me a bit tomorrow/in future.

### Day 9 January 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked a tiny bit on the timer.

**Thoughts**: Was a bloody hot day today, but managed to squeeze in a little bit of work on the timer before bed. Need to figure out how to actually make the timer countdown.

### Day 8 January 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continued developing my 25 + 5 Clock.

**Thoughts**: Spent time getting a basic design of the interval timer, and began thinking about how best to use React to make this timer work.

### Day 7 January 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began work on the final FCC Front End Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Began work on the 25 + 5 Clock challenge, essentially an interval timer. Initially it seems like an easy task. But after starting it I'm beginning to realise it might be deceptively difficult.

### Day 6 January 21, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for a few jobs, and trying to finish the React Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the calculator, I sort of did a re-write. I have two Calculators, one performs as I wanted it to, by replacing operators if they are clicked multiple times in a row. The other calculator passes FCC's Mocha tests, but will instead chain a string of operators as they are pressed, and when the equal's sign is clicked it'll apply logic to determine which operator to use. They're not exactly pretty, but they got the job done :).
The main issue now is how it handles decimal point operations, I would have to add a new function to multiply everything by like a thousand then divide again at the end to avoid miscalculations at very small decimals. But this is an issue with JS and how it performs math.

### Day 5 January 20, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Updated my resume, applied for a Canva Internship role & worked on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: Finishing this calculator is getting real tough, I'm thinking I may need to restart and start fresh to have the tests tick off as completed.

### Day 4 January 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Spent my entire day trying to figure out how to get the decimal place to work for the calculator. My aim is to make it work, and then look to fix everything up. But I have a feeling my approach to making the calculator is actually making it more complex than it needs to be, more specifically; I think my use of state in this React app isn't an ideal way of storing the information.

### Day 3 January 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: I've got it functioning about 50% of how it should, I'm trying to figure out the best way to have the calculator actually perform the equation now. Which is turning out to be a bit more difficult than expected.

### Day 2 January 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the second last FCC Frontend Challenge; JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit rusty, but keen to figure this out over the next few days. Was going to do vanilla JS, but interestingly I realised it would be far easier to use React. I have yet to feel like React was an easier way of coding, as opposed to vanilla JS, but yeh I'm starting to see how on larger projects with many interacting elements how React is an easier language to work in than Vanilla JS. Also, considering this course is a Front End Libraries Course, it feels appropriate to use a front end library.

### Day 1: January 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began a new 100 Day challenge today, began by finishing off a Tensorflow.js tutorial I had started last year.

**Thoughts**: Pretty interesting to get a small insight into Machine Learning, I plan on diving into the topic a bit more in the future. Today was just a short day, but I aim to finish off the Front end Development FCC Course to start this 100 Days, then figure out where to go next after that.
