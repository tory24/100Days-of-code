# Second 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Outline for my Second 100 Days of Code Challenge:
I really enjoyed doing the first 100 days, and it really helped keep me in a rhythm of study and to tackle some projects on a consistent basis.
This time around, I'll aim to do the 100 days over the working week [Monday - Friday], and weekends will be optional.
I am using this challenge to train positive studying habits and to help make my self more accountable in my studies. The challenge will also help me to create more projects that demonstrate what I've learnt, and add to my portfolio.

**My Plan**:
* I will spend a minimum of 1 hour a day studying, whether it's through FCC's courses, Udemy or another resource.
* I will again apply my knowledge by working on small projects, that apply my knowledge.
* I aim to have at least 10 small projects completed by the end of the challenge.
* Am considering doing a bootcamp style course at General Assembly

**What I've Done So Far**:
* [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/WNGWVbj)
* [FCC JS My preferred Calculator](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/BaLqYQL)
* [FCC JS Calculator for FCC Tests](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/KKgYzoK)

### Day 19 February 9, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Set up Wordpress through AWS Lightsail, did some FCC Challenges, and worked on learning some more advanced CSS.

**Thoughts**: Finally took the time to learn how to set up a Wordpress site, decided to go through Lightsail, is simple and easy. But I havent fully learnt how to customise a site properly through Wordpress, I'm finding the tool to be a bit clunky, but keen to give it another go tomorrow, to see what I can make.

### Day 18 February 8, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began learning how to use Wordpress, did some FCC Challenges.

**Thoughts**: Decided that I need to learn how to use wordpress and host a site through AWS, considering Wordpress is used for most sites, and AWS powers most of the internet, learning how to do this would hopefully be beneficial for job prospects.

**Link(s) to Work**: TBC

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 17 February 6, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Making up for missed days, spent some time working on the resume.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying this, is a good way to learn new things and do something that might help me secure a job.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 16 February 5, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Did an hour of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FCC. Then began work on my digital resume.

**Thoughts**: Just going back through HTML, CSS basics to cover anything I might've missed or forgotten about, was properly taught about CSS variables. Also began designing my digital resume, I have an idea of what I want to do, so hopefully I can teach myself how to build a webpage like as I have planned.

**Time**: 4-5 hours


### Day 15 February 4, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up a few FCC Challenges, and began a digital resume.

**Thoughts**: I've applied for a few job but realised I dont have enough skills so I appear as not well rounded. So I'm planning on learning a bit of back end so I can host some projects online and add them to my digital resume which will help me show not tell. Also it will be a good way to broaden my knowledge and abilities.

**Time**: 3 hours~


### Day 14 February 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp. And enquired about General Assembly's short bootcamps.

**Thoughts**: Haven't recieved the certification for the frontend libraries course which is a little annoying. But began the Responsive Web Design course, just to see if there's anything more that might help me with the HTML, CSS basics.
Finding it difficult to appear as a suitable candidate for jobs, so thinking of doing a bootcamp to help get my foot in the door somewhere. 

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 13 February 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finsihed with the FCC Timer

**Thoughts**: I finally got the timer working as expected, it now counts down from the session length, then at zero it will reset to the break length, after this it will reset to the session length and repeat the process until the reset button is pressed or the start/stop button is pressed again. Really happy that I finally got it working, a major change is that I realised it's much easier to use multiple funcitons within the component so that it can access state, rather than placing some generic functions outside the component, which I did for a couple challenges from before.

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 12 February 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working on getting the timer to work as expected.

**Thoughts**: Running into to some trouble, trying to figure out how to update state and immediately call on the updated state in a single call. But the setState callback doesn't seem to work as expected for me. So close to finishing this.

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 11 January 29, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Timer.

**Thoughts**: Struggling to have the timer update when the session length is increased. If I try updating through a function, it updates a few clicks later, so when session is 27, timer is only at 26:00. I think I need to have it update within state, but not quite sure how to get that working.

**Time**: 1.5 hours


### Day 10 January 27, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Timer.

**Thoughts**: Yeh this is tough, I've found code that has helped me to get the timer working. But I'm trying to understand how to stop it, update content on screen as other items update, like updating the timer and the session length is changed. Then after I have that figured out, I'll need to get it to change to the break time. However I've learnt today how to simplify some of my older code by using a variable to change the state in a function.
    i.e this.setState({ [e.target.name] : e.target.value })
So hopefully this helps me a bit tomorrow/in future.

### Day 9 January 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked a tiny bit on the timer.

**Thoughts**: Was a bloody hot day today, but managed to squeeze in a little bit of work on the timer before bed. Need to figure out how to actually make the timer countdown.

### Day 8 January 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continued developing my 25 + 5 Clock.

**Thoughts**: Spent time getting a basic design of the interval timer, and began thinking about how best to use React to make this timer work.

### Day 7 January 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began work on the final FCC Front End Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Began work on the 25 + 5 Clock challenge, essentially an interval timer. Initially it seems like an easy task. But after starting it I'm beginning to realise it might be deceptively difficult.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 6 January 21, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for a few jobs, and trying to finish the React Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the calculator, I sort of did a re-write. I have two Calculators, one performs as I wanted it to, by replacing operators if they are clicked multiple times in a row. The other calculator passes FCC's Mocha tests, but will instead chain a string of operators as they are pressed, and when the equal's sign is clicked it'll apply logic to determine which operator to use. They're not exactly pretty, but they got the job done :).
The main issue now is how it handles decimal point operations, I would have to add a new function to multiply everything by like a thousand then divide again at the end to avoid miscalculations at very small decimals. But this is an issue with JS and how it performs math.

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 5 January 20, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Updated my resume, applied for a Canva Internship role & worked on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: Finishing this calculator is getting real tough, I'm thinking I may need to restart and start fresh to have the tests tick off as completed.

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 4 January 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Spent my entire day trying to figure out how to get the decimal place to work for the calculator. My aim is to make it work, and then look to fix everything up. But I have a feeling my approach to making the calculator is actually making it more complex than it needs to be, more specifically; I think my use of state in this React app isn't an ideal way of storing the information.

### Day 3 January 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: I've got it functioning about 50% of how it should, I'm trying to figure out the best way to have the calculator actually perform the equation now. Which is turning out to be a bit more difficult than expected.

### Day 2 January 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the second last FCC Frontend Challenge; JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit rusty, but keen to figure this out over the next few days. Was going to do vanilla JS, but interestingly I realised it would be far easier to use React. I have yet to feel like React was an easier way of coding, as opposed to vanilla JS, but yeh I'm starting to see how on larger projects with many interacting elements how React is an easier language to work in than Vanilla JS. Also, considering this course is a Front End Libraries Course, it feels appropriate to use a front end library.

### Day 1: January 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began a new 100 Day challenge today, began by finishing off a Tensorflow.js tutorial I had started last year.

**Thoughts**: Pretty interesting to get a small insight into Machine Learning, I plan on diving into the topic a bit more in the future. Today was just a short day, but I aim to finish off the Front end Development FCC Course to start this 100 Days, then figure out where to go next after that.
