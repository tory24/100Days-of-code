# Second 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Outline for my Second 100 Days of Code Challenge:
I really enjoyed doing the first 100 days, and it really helped keep me in a rhythm of study and to tackle some projects on a consistent basis.
This time around, I'll aim to do the 100 days over the working week [Monday - Friday], and weekends will be optional.
I am using this challenge to train positive studying habits and to help make my self more accountable in my studies. The challenge will also help me to create more projects that demonstrate what I've learnt, and add to my portfolio.

**My Plan**:
* I will spend a minimum of 1 hour a day studying, whether it's through FCC's courses, Udemy or another resource.
* I will again apply my knowledge by working on small projects, that apply my knowledge.
* I aim to have at least 10 small projects completed by the end of the challenge.
* Am considering doing a bootcamp style course at General Assembly

### Day 8 January 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continued developing my 25 + 5 Clock.

**Thoughts**: Spent time getting a basic design of the interval timer, and began thinking about how best to use React to make this timer work.

### Day 7 January 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began work on the final FCC Front End Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Began work on the 25 + 5 Clock challenge, essentially an interval timer. Initially it seems like an easy task. But after starting it I'm beginning to realise it might be deceptively difficult.

### Day 6 January 21, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for a few jobs, and trying to finish the React Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the calculator, I sort of did a re-write. I have two Calculators, one performs as I wanted it to, by replacing operators if they are clicked multiple times in a row. The other calculator passes FCC's Mocha tests, but will instead chain a string of operators as they are pressed, and when the equal's sign is clicked it'll apply logic to determine which operator to use. They're not exactly pretty, but they got the job done :).
The main issue now is how it handles decimal point operations, I would have to add a new function to multiply everything by like a thousand then divide again at the end to avoid miscalculations at very small decimals. But this is an issue with JS and how it performs math.

### Day 5 January 20, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Updated my resume, applied for a Canva Internship role & worked on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: Finishing this calculator is getting real tough, I'm thinking I may need to restart and start fresh to have the tests tick off as completed.

### Day 4 January 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Spent my entire day trying to figure out how to get the decimal place to work for the calculator. My aim is to make it work, and then look to fix everything up. But I have a feeling my approach to making the calculator is actually making it more complex than it needs to be, more specifically; I think my use of state in this React app isn't an ideal way of storing the information.

### Day 3 January 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: I've got it functioning about 50% of how it should, I'm trying to figure out the best way to have the calculator actually perform the equation now. Which is turning out to be a bit more difficult than expected.

### Day 2 January 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the second last FCC Frontend Challenge; JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit rusty, but keen to figure this out over the next few days. Was going to do vanilla JS, but interestingly I realised it would be far easier to use React. I have yet to feel like React was an easier way of coding, as opposed to vanilla JS, but yeh I'm starting to see how on larger projects with many interacting elements how React is an easier language to work in than Vanilla JS. Also, considering this course is a Front End Libraries Course, it feels appropriate to use a front end library.

### Day 1: January 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began a new 100 Day challenge today, began by finishing off a Tensorflow.js tutorial I had started last year.

**Thoughts**: Pretty interesting to get a small insight into Machine Learning, I plan on diving into the topic a bit more in the future. Today was just a short day, but I aim to finish off the Front end Development FCC Course to start this 100 Days, then figure out where to go next after that.
