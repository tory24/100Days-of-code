# Second 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Outline for my Second 100 Days of Code Challenge:
I really enjoyed doing the first 100 days, and it really helped keep me in a rhythm of study and to tackle some projects on a consistent basis.
This time around, I'll aim to do the 100 days over the working week [Monday - Friday], and weekends will be optional.
I am using this challenge to train positive studying habits and to help make my self more accountable in my studies. The challenge will also help me to create more projects that demonstrate what I've learnt, and add to my portfolio.

**My Plan**:
* I will spend a minimum of 1 hour a day studying, whether it's through FCC's courses, Udemy or another resource.
* I will again apply my knowledge by working on small projects, that apply my knowledge.
* I aim to have at least 10 small projects completed by the end of the challenge.
* Am considering doing a bootcamp style course at General Assembly
