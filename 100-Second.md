# Second 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Outline for my Second 100 Days of Code Challenge:
I really enjoyed doing the first 100 days, and it really helped keep me in a rhythm of study and to tackle some projects on a consistent basis.
This time around, I'll aim to do the 100 days over the working week [Monday - Friday], and weekends will be optional.
I am using this challenge to train positive studying habits and to help make my self more accountable in my studies. The challenge will also help me to create more projects that demonstrate what I've learnt, and add to my portfolio.

**My Plan**:
* I will spend a minimum of 1 hour a day studying, whether it's through FCC's courses, Udemy or another resource.
* I will again apply my knowledge by working on small projects, that apply my knowledge.
* I aim to have at least 10 small projects completed by the end of the challenge.
* Am considering doing a bootcamp style course at General Assembly

### Day 34 March 8 2021
**Today's Progress**: Spent time helping a friend with an algorithm, and worked some more on the FCC Portfolio Page challenge.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Portfolio Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/PobaxLj)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 33 March 4, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a personal project with a friend who's a dev, and started the final project of FCC's Responsive Web Design Certificate.

**Thoughts**: I'm getting faster at setting up a page, but the course only uses HTML & CSS. But it's cool to notice how I've improved/changed my approach to starting projects.

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 32 March 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC's Certificate's 4th Project

**Thoughts**: Decided to work on the next challenge, which is to make a Technical Documentation Page. Was for the most page very easy. Had the most trouble with setting the anchor's for when the page is under 900px, when the media query kicks in, as I wanted the navbar to stay in a fix position. So I tried a bunch of techniques suggested in stackoverflow, and finding a new feature I hadn't heard of before 'scroll-padding-top:' which I set to the height of the navbar. And pretty much fixed the issue I was stuck on for over an hour.

**Time**: 6 hours~


### Day 31 March 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for an Atlassian Internship, and worked a bit on the FCC Chalenge.

**Thoughts**: Probably spent a bit too long fretting over my cover letter, but it's stressful applying for a role that seems perfect for me. I just hope they consider me. Also the product landing page is coming together, I think I'll try finish it off tomorrow, it already meets the challenge criteria, but I want to make it look good, the colours are a bit gross at the moment.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Landing Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/abBVRKv)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 30 March 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the 3rd FCC Responsive Web Design challenge, and spent time looking for jobs.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying trying to build a webpage, its challenging and fun to watch it slowly come to life. Also been looking at and applying for some junior roles, no bites yet, but hoping I get that one company that is willing to take a chance and hire me.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Landing Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/abBVRKv)

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 29 February 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for some jobs, and began working on my digital portfolio again.

**Thoughts**: Testing how to build this site is pretty enjoyable, just stressful thinking about how best to build it, since it demonstrates my work, and shows who I am as a developer.

**Time**: 


### Day 28 February 24, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through the 3rd challenge in the FCC Responsive Web Design Cert.

**Thoughts**: This one's a little harder, just trying to understand how to align items properly along a navbar is a bit confusing.

**Link(s) to Work**: [FCC Landing Page](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/abBVRKv)

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 27 February 23, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through FCC Responsive Web Design Certificate.

**Thoughts**: Working through the flexbox section, I realised how poorly codecademy teaches flexbox, my notes were very brief and confusing. So FCC explained things a bit more clearly, but did not cover as many features of flexbox.

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 26 February 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through FCC Responsive Web Design Certificate.

**Thoughts**: Getting back into it, last week was a bit all over the place. Working through the Responsive Web Design Certificate on FCC. It's been very easy, but nice to learn a bit more about the accessibility features of HTML, and animation in CSS, something I'm keen to explore a bit more.

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 25 February 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Responsive Web Design challenges.

**Thoughts**: Only made it through a few challenges, and applied for a job, which took longer than expected.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 24 February 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Challenges & my portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Needed to get back into a rhythm, the FCC Challenges really help to quickly get back into a learning routine. Also decided to skip ahead and finish the first FCC challenge, to see if I knew enough. Was easy enough, was tasked with building a basic tribute page which I centred around Kobe Bryant, I based it on the example tribute page they provide, but changed it up a litte. But I learnt about a few HTML tags I hadn't encountered before, <cite>, <blockquote> & <figcaption>. The last of which I learnt about but had never used.

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 23 February 15, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished the Mandalorian Helmet, then began work on my digital resume again.

**Thoughts**: Found it hard to stop working on the little CSS project I'm doing. But it's not super useful when compared to trying to make a digital portfolio. So worked a bit on improving that. I guess some of the CSS may come in handy later down the track. I thought of an idea for a portfolio that may double as both a way to promote myself & demonstrate various skills, like knowledge of CRUD, and how to utilise a RESTful API.

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 22 February 12, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Ended up beginning a new Mandalorian helmet, but with a bit more detail.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying this CSS challenge, its a fun way of looking at how to design something with quite restrictive constraints. Might start looking at webkits soon and see how they work.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Mandalorian Github](https://github.com/tory24/mandalorian-minimalist)

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 21 February 11, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working on the Mandalorian Helmet project.

**Thoughts**: Got a bit carried away today and finished my Boba Fett Helmet by writing it purely in CSS. Was actually a lot of fun and kind of relaxing, but stressful at the same time.

**Link(s) to Work**: [Boba Fett Codepen](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/JjbbXNq)

**Time**: 5 hours


### Day 20 February 10, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked through a tutorial to make a page similar to the Apple Airpods page. Worked on using CSS and HTML project.

**Thoughts**: Followed a tutorial to recreate how Apple displayed the airpods on their webpage. Learnt how to map a user's scroll to loading a new image on page, and also learnt about preloading, and how it can dramatically speed up the user experience. However it also dramatically increases download sizes, especially when loading 147 high quality images. As a result of this, I learnt about the CDN and how it helps across most of the internet to reduce load times etc. I only have a basic understanding but I realise how important it is for many companies.

Decided to try use pure CSS and HTML to make Boba Fett's helment in a minimalist art style. I think it's mostly doable, and it should hopefully teach me some new little tricks and aspects of CSS that I don't yet know. Managed to get the base green helmet done, need to get the red visor and a few extra bits in.

**Link(s) to Work**: TBA

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 19 February 9, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Set up Wordpress through AWS Lightsail, did some FCC Challenges, and worked on learning some more advanced CSS.

**Thoughts**: Finally took the time to learn how to set up a Wordpress site, decided to go through Lightsail, is simple and easy. But I havent fully learnt how to customise a site properly through Wordpress, I'm finding the tool to be a bit clunky, but keen to give it another go tomorrow, to see what I can make. Did a few FCC Challenges and fixed up my timer a bit, added some colour.

**Link(s) to Work**: TBC

**Time**: 4 hours


### Day 18 February 8, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began learning how to use Wordpress, did some FCC Challenges.

**Thoughts**: Decided that I need to learn how to use wordpress and host a site through AWS, considering Wordpress is used for most sites, and AWS powers most of the internet, learning how to do this would hopefully be beneficial for job prospects.

**Link(s) to Work**: TBC

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 17 February 6, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Making up for missed days, spent some time working on the resume.

**Thoughts**: Enjoying this, is a good way to learn new things and do something that might help me secure a job.

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 16 February 5, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Did an hour of the Responsive Web Design Certification on FCC. Then began work on my digital resume.

**Thoughts**: Just going back through HTML, CSS basics to cover anything I might've missed or forgotten about, was properly taught about CSS variables. Also began designing my digital resume, I have an idea of what I want to do, so hopefully I can teach myself how to build a webpage like as I have planned.

**Link(s) to Work**:

**Time**: 4-5 hours


### Day 15 February 4, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up a few FCC Challenges, and began a digital resume.

**Thoughts**: I've applied for a few job but realised I dont have enough skills so I appear as not well rounded. So I'm planning on learning a bit of back end so I can host some projects online and add them to my digital resume which will help me show not tell. Also it will be a good way to broaden my knowledge and abilities.

**Link(s) to Work**: [My Codepen Profile](https://codepen.io/tory24)

**Time**: 3 hours~


### Day 14 February 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began the Responsive Web Design Certification in FreeCodeCamp. And enquired about General Assembly's short bootcamps.

**Thoughts**: Haven't recieved the certification for the frontend libraries course which is a little annoying. But began the Responsive Web Design course, just to see if there's anything more that might help me with the HTML, CSS basics.
Finding it difficult to appear as a suitable candidate for jobs, so thinking of doing a bootcamp to help get my foot in the door somewhere. 

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 13 February 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finsihed with the FCC Timer

**Thoughts**: I finally got the timer working as expected, it now counts down from the session length, then at zero it will reset to the break length, after this it will reset to the session length and repeat the process until the reset button is pressed or the start/stop button is pressed again. Really happy that I finally got it working, a major change is that I realised it's much easier to use multiple funcitons within the component so that it can access state, rather than placing some generic functions outside the component, which I did for a couple challenges from before.

**Time**: 3 hours


### Day 12 February 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working on getting the timer to work as expected.

**Thoughts**: Running into to some trouble, trying to figure out how to update state and immediately call on the updated state in a single call. But the setState callback doesn't seem to work as expected for me. So close to finishing this.

**Link(s) to Work**: [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/WNGWVbj)

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 11 January 29, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on FCC Timer.

**Thoughts**: Struggling to have the timer update when the session length is increased. If I try updating through a function, it updates a few clicks later, so when session is 27, timer is only at 26:00. I think I need to have it update within state, but not quite sure how to get that working.

**Link(s) to Work**: [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/WNGWVbj)

**Time**: 1.5 hours


### Day 10 January 27, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Timer.

**Thoughts**: Yeh this is tough, I've found code that has helped me to get the timer working. But I'm trying to understand how to stop it, update content on screen as other items update, like updating the timer and the session length is changed. Then after I have that figured out, I'll need to get it to change to the break time. However I've learnt today how to simplify some of my older code by using a variable to change the state in a function.
    i.e this.setState({ [e.target.name] : e.target.value })
So hopefully this helps me a bit tomorrow/in future.

**Time**: 2 hours


### Day 9 January 26, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked a tiny bit on the timer.

**Thoughts**: Was a bloody hot day today, but managed to squeeze in a little bit of work on the timer before bed. Need to figure out how to actually make the timer countdown.

**Link(s) to Work**: [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/WNGWVbj)

**Time**: 30min


### Day 8 January 25, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Continued developing my 25 + 5 Clock.

**Thoughts**: Spent time getting a basic design of the interval timer, and began thinking about how best to use React to make this timer work.

**Link(s) to Work**: [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/WNGWVbj)

**Time**: 2 hours  display: inline-block;


### Day 7 January 22, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began work on the final FCC Front End Challenge.

**Thoughts**: Began work on the 25 + 5 Clock challenge, essentially an interval timer. Initially it seems like an easy task. But after starting it I'm beginning to realise it might be deceptively difficult.

**Link(s) to Work**: [25 + 5 Clock](https://codepen.io/tory24/pen/WNGWVbj)

**Time**: 1 hour


### Day 6 January 21, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Applied for a few jobs, and trying to finish the React Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Finally finished the calculator, I sort of did a re-write. I have two Calculators, one performs as I wanted it to, by replacing operators if they are clicked multiple times in a row. The other calculator passes FCC's Mocha tests, but will instead chain a string of operators as they are pressed, and when the equal's sign is clicked it'll apply logic to determine which operator to use. They're not exactly pretty, but they got the job done :).
The main issue now is how it handles decimal point operations, I would have to add a new function to multiply everything by like a thousand then divide again at the end to avoid miscalculations at very small decimals. But this is an issue with JS and how it performs math.

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 5 January 20, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Updated my resume, applied for a Canva Internship role & worked on the Calculator

**Thoughts**: Finishing this calculator is getting real tough, I'm thinking I may need to restart and start fresh to have the tests tick off as completed.

**Time**: 4 hours~


### Day 4 January 19, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Spent my entire day trying to figure out how to get the decimal place to work for the calculator. My aim is to make it work, and then look to fix everything up. But I have a feeling my approach to making the calculator is actually making it more complex than it needs to be, more specifically; I think my use of state in this React app isn't an ideal way of storing the information.

**Time**:


### Day 3 January 18, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Work on the JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: I've got it functioning about 50% of how it should, I'm trying to figure out the best way to have the calculator actually perform the equation now. Which is turning out to be a bit more difficult than expected.

**Time**: 2 hours~


### Day 2 January 14, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the second last FCC Frontend Challenge; JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit rusty, but keen to figure this out over the next few days. Was going to do vanilla JS, but interestingly I realised it would be far easier to use React. I have yet to feel like React was an easier way of coding, as opposed to vanilla JS, but yeh I'm starting to see how on larger projects with many interacting elements how React is an easier language to work in than Vanilla JS. Also, considering this course is a Front End Libraries Course, it feels appropriate to use a front end library.

**Time**: 1 hour~


### Day 1: January 13, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Began a new 100 Day challenge today, began by finishing off a Tensorflow.js tutorial I had started last year.

**Thoughts**: Pretty interesting to get a small insight into Machine Learning, I plan on diving into the topic a bit more in the future. Today was just a short day, but I aim to finish off the Front end Development FCC Course to start this 100 Days, then figure out where to go next after that.
